# I Created Morning Azkar Website In Arabic With ChatGPT

::: info

In a hury, here is the generated page. [Islamic Zikr](https://muath-ye.github.io/chatgpt-simple-js-code/chatGPT.html)

:::

Azkar is the plural of Zikr and refers to remembrances. The morning and evening Zikr are a collection of duʿās and remembrances prescribed by the Messenger ﷺ which a Muslim should read on a daily basis in the morning and evening.

This is my first experiment with ChatGPT.

ChatGPT is a chatbot launched by OpenAI in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 family of large language models, and is fine-tuned with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.

I asked ChatGPT to create a web page with JavaScript code that displays the morning Zikr as a rosary (Sabha) so that the user sees the first Zikr and then clicks on the Zikr repeatedly for a certain number of clicks to display the next Zikr and so on until the last Zikr.

Here is an screenshot of what I got.
