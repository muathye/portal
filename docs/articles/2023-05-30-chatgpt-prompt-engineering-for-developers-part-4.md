## Inferring

In this lesson, you will infer sentiment and topics from product reviews and news articles.

## Setup

```python
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

## Product review text

```python
lamp_review = """
Needed a nice lamp for my bedroom, and this one had \
additional storage and not too high of a price point. \
Got it fast.  The string to our lamp broke during the \
transit and the company happily sent over a new one. \
Came within a few days as well. It was easy to put \
together.  I had a missing part, so I contacted their \
support and they very quickly got me the missing piece! \
Lumina seems to me to be a great company that cares \
about their customers and products!!
"""
```

## Sentiment (positive/negative)

```python
prompt = f"""
What is the sentiment of the following product review, 
which is delimited with triple backticks?

"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

> output:

```txt
The sentiment of the product review is positive.
```

```python
prompt = f"""
What is the sentiment of the following product review, 
which is delimited with triple backticks?

Give your answer as a single word, either "positive" \
or "negative".

Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

> output:

```txt
positive
```

## Identify types of emotions

```python
prompt = f"""
Identify a list of emotions that the writer of the \
following review is expressing. Include no more than \
five items in the list. Format your answer as a list of \

"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

> output:

```txt
happy, satisfied, impressed, grateful, pleased
```

## Identify anger

```python
prompt = f"""
Is the writer of the following review expressing anger?\

```

## Extract product and company name from customer reviews

```python
prompt = f"""
Identify the following items from the review text:

If the information isn't present, use "unknown" \
as the value.
Make your response as short as possible.
  
Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

> output:

```json

print(response)
```

> output:

```json
{
  "Sentiment": "positive",
  "Anger": false,
  "Item": "lamp",
  "Brand": "Lumina"

## Inferring topics

```python
story = """
In a recent survey conducted by the government, 
public sector employees were asked to rate their level 
of satisfaction with the department they work at. 
The results revealed that NASA was the most popular 
department with a satisfaction rating of 95%.

One NASA employee, John Smith, commented on the findings, 
stating, "I'm not surprised that NASA came out on top. 
It's a great place to work with amazing people and 
incredible opportunities. I'm proud to be a part of 
such an innovative organization."

The results were also welcomed by NASA's management team, 
with Director Tom Johnson stating, "We are thrilled to 
hear that our employees are satisfied with their work at NASA. 
We have a talented and dedicated team who work tirelessly 
to achieve our goals, and it's fantastic to see that their 
hard work is paying off."

The survey also revealed that the 
Social Security Administration had the lowest satisfaction 
rating, with only 45% of employees indicating they were 
satisfied with their job. The government has pledged to 
address the concerns raised by employees in the survey and 
work towards improving job satisfaction across all departments.

"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

> output

```txt
survey, satisfaction rating, NASA, Social Security Administration, job satisfaction
```

```python
response.split(sep=',')
```

```txt

['survey',
 ' satisfaction rating',
 ' NASA',
 ' Social Security Administration',
 ' job satisfaction']
```

```python
topic_list = [
    "nasa", "local government", "engineering", 
    "employee satisfaction", "federal government"

print(response)
```

> output:

```txt
nasa: 1
local government: 0
engineering: 0
employee satisfaction: 1
federal government: 1
```

```python
topic_dict = {i.split(': ')[0]: int(i.split(': ')[1]) for i in response.split(sep='\n')}
