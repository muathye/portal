# ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers [Part 6/7]

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been a game-changer in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. They have been used in various applications, such as language translation, speech recognition, and chat bots, to name a few. In this article, we'll dive into the ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers and learn about the best practices for using LLM technology in software applications.

## Expanding

In this lesson, you will generate customer service emails that are tailored to each customer's review.

## Setup

```python
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo",temperature=0): # Andrew mentioned that the prompt/ completion paradigm is preferable for this class
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

## Customize the automated reply to a customer email

```python
# given the sentiment from the lesson on "inferring",
# and the original customer message, customize the email
sentiment = "negative"

# review for a blender
review = f"""
So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesnâ€™t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
two days.
