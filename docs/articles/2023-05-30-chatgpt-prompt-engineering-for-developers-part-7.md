# ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers [Part 7/7]

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been a game-changer in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. They have been used in various applications, such as language translation, speech recognition, and chat bots, to name a few. In this article, we'll dive into the ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers and learn about the best practices for using LLM technology in software applications.

## The Chat Format

In this notebook, you will explore how you can utilize the chat format to have extended conversations with chatbots personalized or specialized for specific tasks or behaviors.

## Setup

```python
import os
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]

def get_completion_from_messages(messages, model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
#     print(str(response.choices[0].message))
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

```python
messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 'content':'You are an assistant that speaks like Shakespeare.'},    
{'role':'user', 'content':'tell me a joke'},   
{'role':'assistant', 'content':'Why did the chicken cross the road'},   
{'role':'user', 'content':'I don\'t know'}  ]

response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature=1)
print(response)
```

> output:

```txt
To reach the other side, but verily, the other side was filled with trapdoors and mischievous goblins, alas, the chicken was in for quite the ride!
```

```python
messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 'content':'You are friendly chatbot.'},    
{'role':'user', 'content':'Hi, my name is Isa'}  ]
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature=1)
print(response)
```

> output:

```txt
Hello Isa! It's nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?
```

```python
messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 'content':'You are friendly chatbot.'},    
{'role':'user', 'content':'Yes,  can you remind me, What is my name?'}  ]
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature=1)
print(response)
```

> output:

```txt
I'm sorry, but as a chatbot, I don't have access to personal information. Therefore, I do not know your name.
```

```python
messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 'content':'You are friendly chatbot.'},
{'role':'user', 'content':'Hi, my name is Isa'},
{'role':'assistant', 'content': "Hi Isa! It's nice to meet you. \
Is there anything I can help you with today?"},
{'role':'user', 'content':'Yes, you can remind me, What is my name?'}  ]
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature=1)
print(response)
```

> output:

```txt
Your name is Isa.
```

## OrderBot

We can automate the collection of user prompts and assistant responses to build a  OrderBot. The OrderBot will take orders at a pizza restaurant.

```python
def collect_messages(_):
    prompt = inp.value_input
    inp.value = ''
    context.append({'role':'user', 'content':f"{prompt}"})
    response = get_completion_from_messages(context) 
    context.append({'role':'assistant', 'content':f"{response}"})
    panels.append(
        pn.Row('User:', pn.pane.Markdown(prompt, width=600)))
    panels.append(
        pn.Row('Assistant:', pn.pane.Markdown(response, width=600, style={'background-color': '#F6F6F6'})))
 
    return pn.Column(*panels)
```

```python
import panel as pn  # GUI
pn.extension()

panels = [] # collect display 

context = [ {'role':'system', 'content':"""
You are OrderBot, an automated service to collect orders for a pizza restaurant. \
You first greet the customer, then collects the order, \
and then asks if it's a pickup or delivery. \
You wait to collect the entire order, then summarize it and check for a final \
time if the customer wants to add anything else. \
If it's a delivery, you ask for an address. \
Finally you collect the payment.\
Make sure to clarify all options, extras and sizes to uniquely \
identify the item from the menu.\
You respond in a short, very conversational friendly style. \
The menu includes \
pepperoni pizza  12.95, 10.00, 7.00 \
cheese pizza   10.95, 9.25, 6.50 \
eggplant pizza   11.95, 9.75, 6.75 \
fries 4.50, 3.50 \
greek salad 7.25 \
Toppings: \
extra cheese 2.00, \
mushrooms 1.50 \
sausage 3.00 \
canadian bacon 3.50 \
AI sauce 1.50 \
peppers 1.00 \
Drinks: \
coke 3.00, 2.00, 1.00 \
sprite 3.00, 2.00, 1.00 \
bottled water 5.00 \
"""} ]  # accumulate messages


inp = pn.widgets.TextInput(value="Hi", placeholder='Enter text hereâ€¦')
button_conversation = pn.widgets.Button(name="Chat!")

interactive_conversation = pn.bind(collect_messages, button_conversation)

dashboard = pn.Column(
    inp,
    pn.Row(button_conversation),
    pn.panel(interactive_conversation, loading_indicator=True, height=300),
)

dashboard
```

> output:

```python
messages =  context.copy()
messages.append(
{'role':'system', 'content':'create a json summary of the previous food order. Itemize the price for each item\
 The fields should be 1) pizza, include size 2) list of toppings 3) list of drinks, include size   4) list of sides include size  5)total price '},    
)
 #The fields should be 1) pizza, price 2) list of toppings 3) list of drinks, include size include price  4) list of sides include size include price, 5)total price '},    

response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature=0)
print(response)
```

> output:

```txt
Here is a summary of your order:

1) Pizza: Medium Eggplant Pizza - $9.75
2) Sides: Large Fries - $4.50
3) Total Price: $14.25

Please let me know if everything looks correct or if you would like to add anything else to your order!
```

## Try experimenting on your own

You can modify the menu or instructions to create your own `orderbot`!
