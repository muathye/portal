# Convert png and jpg to webp

This is a command written in a batch file or command prompt for Windows operating system.

The command starts with a "for" loop that loops through all files in the current directory that have a ".png", ".jpg" or ".jpeg" extension.

For each file that matches this criteria, the command uses the "cwebp" tool to convert the file to the WebP image format with a quality level of 80.

The output file is named using the original file name (without the ".png", ".jpg" or ".jpeg" extension) and with a ".webp" extension.

So essentially, this command is converting all PNG , JPG or JPEG image files in the current directory to WebP format with a quality level of 80.
