# I Created Morning Azkar Website In Arabic With ChatGPT

::: info

In a hury, here is the generated page. [Islamic Zikr](https://muath-ye.github.io/chatgpt-simple-js-code/chatGPT.html)

:::

Azkar is the plural of Zikr and refers to remembrances. The morning and evening Zikr are a collection of duʿās and remembrances prescribed by the Messenger ﷺ which a Muslim should read on a daily basis in the morning and evening.

This is my first experiment with ChatGPT.

ChatGPT is a chatbot launched by OpenAI in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 family of large language models, and is fine-tuned with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.

I asked ChatGPT to generate a webpage with a JavaScript code that displays the morning Azkar as Sabha so the user will see the fist Zikr then click on the Zikr repeatedly for number of clicks to display the next Zikr and so on unitl the last Zikr.

Here is an screenshot of what I got.
